# Discord Bot Dashboard

An advanced Discord bot dashboard for managing partnerships, analytics, and server configurations.

## Project Overview

This is a full-stack web application that provides a comprehensive dashboard for Discord bot management. Users can authenticate with Discord, select a server, and configure various bot settings including partnerships, channels, categories, and premium features.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Wouter (routing), TanStack Query (data fetching)
- **Backend**: Express.js, Discord.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components
- **Storage**: In-memory storage (MemStorage)
- **Authentication**: Discord OAuth2 integration via Replit Connectors

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features

**Frontend:**
- âœ… All data schemas and TypeScript interfaces
- âœ… Complete UI for all pages (server selector, dashboard, analytics, configs)
- âœ… Sidebar navigation with server branding
- âœ… Form components with validation and error handling
- âœ… Responsive design implementation
- âœ… **Form state persistence** - All config forms now correctly load and display saved values

**Backend:**
- âœ… Discord API integration (user info, servers, channels, server details)
- âœ… All API endpoints for CRUD operations
- âœ… Analytics data generation
- âœ… Configuration storage and caching

**Integration:**
- âœ… All pages connected to backend APIs
- âœ… Loading states and error handling
- âœ… Form validation with real-time feedback
- âœ… Application running successfully

### ðŸ”„ Authentication Approach

**Current Implementation:**
The application uses Replit Discord Connector for authentication. This provides:
- Single-user authentication (the connector owner)
- Access to all servers the authenticated user is in
- Server selection and configuration management
- Suitable for personal bot dashboard use

**For Multi-User Support:**
If you need multiple users to log in with their own Discord accounts, you would need:
1. Implement Discord OAuth2 authorization code flow
2. Add session management (cookies + session store)
3. Per-user token storage and scoping
4. User-specific configuration isolation
