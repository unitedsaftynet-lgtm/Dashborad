### üîê Authentication System

**Current Implementation (NEW!):**
The application uses standard Discord OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow with your Discord bot credentials. This provides:
- ‚úÖ Multi-user authentication - any Discord user can log in
- ‚úÖ Session-based authentication with express-session
- ‚úÖ Server ownership filtering - only servers the user owns are shown
- ‚úÖ Bot presence detection - shows which servers have the bot installed
- ‚úÖ Bot invite functionality - easy one-click bot invitation to servers

**Required Environment Variables:**
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` - Your Discord application's client ID
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` - Your Discord application's client secret  
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` - Your Discord bot token
- `SESSION_SECRET` - (Optional) Custom session secret for production

**Authentication Flow:**
1. User clicks "Sign in with Discord" on the login page
2. Redirected to Discord for OAuth approval
3. Discord redirects back to `/api/auth/callback` with authorization code
4. Backend exchanges code for access token and stores in session
5. User can now access all protected routes with their Discord identity

**Server Filtering:**
- Only servers where the authenticated user is the **owner** are displayed
- Servers are sorted: bot-present servers first, then bot-absent servers
- Each server shows:
  - Owner badge
  - Bot active status (if bot is in the server)
  - "Manage" button (if bot is present) 
  - "Invite Bot" button (if bot is not present)

## Features
